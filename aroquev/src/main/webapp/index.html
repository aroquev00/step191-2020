      <h1>Armando Roque's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi and welcome to my personal portfolio! I am Armando, and I am <span id="armando-age-container"></span> years old. I was born in Monterrey, Mexico, and I have lived there ever since. I am currently studying Computer Science
      at Tec de Monterrey. During the Summer of 2020 I will be working as a Google intern in the STEP program, really exciting stuff!</p>
