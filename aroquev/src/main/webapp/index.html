      <h1>Armando Roque's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi and welcome to my personal portfolio! I am Armando, and here you will find interesting things about me (thanks for being interested!). I am currently studying Computer Science
      at Tec de Monterrey. During the Summer of 2020 I will be working as a Google intern in the STEP program (this is where this project was born), really exciting stuff!</p>

			<h2>About me</h2>
			<h3>My Background</h3>
			<p>I was born in Monterrey and have lived there ever since. Currently I am <span id="armando-age-container"></span> years old. I live with my partents and my brother Gabriel, who is also into Computer Science.</p>
			<p>I attended elementary and junior high school at Regio Contry, a Lasallian school where I spent 9 years (it is amazing to realize how much time I spent in those classrooms). After that I attended Prepa Tec Eugenio Garza Laguera High School, where I had so much fun and met many of my best friends. I also learned a lot, and I had the opportunity to take IB classes (Math, Business Management and Computer Science). After that I was admitted to Tec de Monterrey, and I've studying Computer Science there since 2018.</p>
			<h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
			<p>I was interested in technology since I was young, since my father has always been a computer enthusiast, so I had the chance to play with electronic gadgets as I was growing up. I was formally introduced to Computer Science in high school, where I worked with Java. After that, I figured out that I could continue learning about this interesting field of study and decided to major in it. The topics I am currently interested in are <b>machine learning, blockchain, computer vision and complexity theory</b>.</p>
